# General Purpose JAX-based Controller

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **AI Programming (IT-3105)** course at NTNU (Spring 2025). The objective is to build a modular, JAX-powered system for PID control that supports both classic and AI-based approaches. The system will simulate various controllable plants and optimize controller parameters using gradient-based methods.

## Key Objectives

- **Learn JAX:** Gain hands-on experience with JAX for automatic differentiation.
- **Implement Controllers:** Develop both traditional and neural network-based PID controllers.
- **Simulate Plants:** Work with:
- The Bathtub Model.
- The Cournot Competition Model.
- A custom plant model of your choice.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily add new plants or controllers.
- **Visualization:**
- MSE progression across epochs.
- Parameter evolution for classic PID controllers.
- **Gradient-Based Learning:** Optimize controller parameters via JAX's automatic differentiation.

## Deliverables

- **Codebase:** Modular, maintainable, and adhering to course coding standards.
- **Lab Report:**
- Configuration summaries for 6 runs (3 plants Ã— 2 controllers).
- Visualizations of MSE and PID parameter evolution.
- Description of the third plant model.

## Notes

- **Due Date:** February 6, 2025.
- **Documentation:** Ensure all code is commented and meets the guidelines in [Code Expectations](https://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/it3105/materials/code-expectations.pdf).
- **Time Management:** Allocate sufficient time for tuning and debugging.
